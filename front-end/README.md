# Front-end

This front end contains all the UI that is used for CRUD operations with Characters, and answering questions for those characters.

The initial user info requests gets sent in the [header](./src/app/shared/../components/shared/header/header.component.ts). 

## Used packages:

- *[Angular Material](https://material.angular.io)* with a custom theme as CSS and UI Component framework.  
- *[ngx-toaster](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-toastr)* package for popups.
- *[ngx-cookie-service](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-cookie-service)* to save login data inside the cookies.
